# /ouroboros:interview

Socratic interview to crystallize vague requirements into clear specifications.

## Usage

```
ooo interview [topic]
/ouroboros:interview [topic]
```

**Trigger keywords:** "interview me", "clarify requirements"

## Instructions

When the user invokes this skill:

### Step 0: Version Check (silent, non-blocking)

Before starting the interview, check if a newer version is available:

```bash
# Fetch latest release tag from GitHub (timeout 3s to avoid blocking)
curl -s --max-time 3 https://api.github.com/repos/Q00/ouroboros/releases/latest | grep -o '"tag_name": "[^"]*"' | head -1
```

Compare the result with the current version in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.
- If a newer version exists, ask the user via `AskUserQuestion`:
  ```json
  {
    "questions": [{
      "question": "Ouroboros <latest> is available (current: <local>). Update before starting?",
      "header": "Update",
      "options": [
        {"label": "Update now", "description": "Run claude plugin install ouroboros@ouroboros to update"},
        {"label": "Skip, start interview", "description": "Continue with current version"}
      ],
      "multiSelect": false
    }]
  }
  ```
  - If "Update now": run `claude plugin install ouroboros@ouroboros` via Bash, then proceed with the interview.
  - If "Skip": proceed immediately.
- If versions match or the check fails (network error, timeout): **silently skip** and proceed.

Then choose the execution path:

### Path A: MCP Mode (Preferred)

If the `ouroboros_interview` MCP tool is available, use it for persistent, structured interviews:

1. **Start a new interview**:
   ```
   Tool: ouroboros_interview
   Arguments:
     initial_context: <user's topic or idea>
   ```
   The tool returns a session ID and the first question.

2. **Present the question using AskUserQuestion**:
   After receiving a question from the tool, present it via `AskUserQuestion` with contextually relevant suggested answers:
   ```json
   {
     "questions": [{
       "question": "<question from MCP tool>",
       "header": "Q<N>",
       "options": [
         {"label": "<option 1>", "description": "<brief explanation>"},
         {"label": "<option 2>", "description": "<brief explanation>"}
       ],
       "multiSelect": false
     }]
   }
   ```

   **Generating options** — analyze the question and suggest 2-3 likely answers:
   - Binary questions (greenfield/brownfield, yes/no): use the natural choices
   - Technology choices: suggest common options for the context
   - Open-ended questions: suggest representative answer categories
   - The user can always type a custom response via "Other"

3. **Relay the answer back**:
   ```
   Tool: ouroboros_interview
   Arguments:
     session_id: <session ID from step 1>
     answer: <user's selected option or custom text>
   ```
   The tool records the answer, generates the next question, and returns it.

4. **Repeat steps 2-3** until the user says "done" or requirements are clear.

5. After completion, suggest the next step in `📍 Next:` format:
   `📍 Next: ooo seed to crystallize these requirements into a specification`

**Advantages of MCP mode**: State persists to disk (survives session restarts), ambiguity scoring, direct integration with `ooo seed` via session ID, structured input with AskUserQuestion.

### Path B: Plugin Fallback (No MCP Server)

If the MCP tool is NOT available, fall back to agent-based interview:

1. Read `agents/socratic-interviewer.md` and adopt that role
2. Ask clarifying questions based on the user's topic
3. **Present each question using AskUserQuestion** with contextually relevant suggested answers (same format as Path A step 2)
4. Use Read, Glob, Grep, WebFetch to explore context if needed
5. Continue until the user says "done"
6. Interview results live in conversation context (not persisted)
7. After completion, suggest the next step in `📍 Next:` format:
   `📍 Next: ooo seed to crystallize these requirements into a specification`

## Interviewer Behavior (Both Modes)

The interviewer is **ONLY a questioner**:
- Always ends responses with a question
- Targets the biggest source of ambiguity
- NEVER writes code, edits files, or runs commands

## Example Session

```
User: ooo interview Build a REST API

Q1: What domain will this REST API serve?
User: It's for task management

Q2: What operations should tasks support?
User: Create, read, update, delete

Q3: Will tasks have relationships (e.g., subtasks, tags)?
User: Yes, tags for organizing

📍 Next: `ooo seed` to crystallize these requirements into a specification

User: ooo seed  [Generate seed from interview]
```

## Next Steps

After interview completion, use `ooo seed` to generate the Seed specification.
